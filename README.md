General description:
This creation was my first experience with OOP C# XNA for Xbox360. I thought it would be fun to make a retro ladder 
game where you had to fight against different enemies a way through the dungeons. At first I wanted to make 
multiple levels but the collision and battle system took me more time then i would have tought. Although it only has
one level and isnt multiplayer i learned a lot from it.
